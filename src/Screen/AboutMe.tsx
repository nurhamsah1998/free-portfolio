        Hello, my name is Nurhamsah, nice to meet you. I am a Frontend developer
        and designer. I am very happy with writing code and designing a brand
        logo and I am interested in new knowledge about programming or designers
        in today's all-digital era. I hope that when you see my profile, you are
        interested in working with me.
      </p>
